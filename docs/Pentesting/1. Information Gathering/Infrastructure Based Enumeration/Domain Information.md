The first point of presence on the Internet may be the `SSL certificate` from the company's main website that we can examine. Often, such a certificate includes more than just a subdomain, and this means that the certificate is used for several domains, and these are most likely still active.

Another source to find more subdomains is [crt.sh](https://crt.sh/). This source is [Certificate Transparency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_Transparency) logs. Certificate Transparency is a process that is intended to enable the verification of issued digital certificates for encrypted Internet connections. The standard ([RFC 6962](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6962)) provides for the logging of all digital certificates issued by a certificate authority in audit-proof logs. This is intended to enable the detection of false or maliciously issued certificates for a domain. SSL certificate providers like [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) share this with the web interface [crt.sh](https://crt.sh/), which stores the new entries in the database to be accessed later.

We can also output the results in JSON format.

If needed, we can also have them filtered by the unique subdomains.

Next, we can identify the hosts directly accessible from the Internet and not hosted by third-party providers. This is because we are not allowed to test the hosts without the permission of third-party providers.

Once we see which hosts can be investigated further, we can generate a list of IP addresses with a minor adjustment to the `cut` command and run them through `Shodan`.

[Shodan](https://www.shodan.io/) can be used to find devices and systems permanently connected to the Internet like `Internet of Things` (`IoT`). It searches the Internet for open TCP/IP ports and filters the systems according to specific terms and criteria. For example, open HTTP or HTTPS ports and other server ports for `FTP`, `SSH`, `SNMP`, `Telnet`, `RTSP`, or `SIP` are searched. As a result, we can find devices and systems, such as `surveillance cameras`, `servers`, `smart home systems`, `industrial controllers`, `traffic lights` and `traffic controllers`, and various network components.
