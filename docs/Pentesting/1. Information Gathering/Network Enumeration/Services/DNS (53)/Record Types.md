Different `DNS records` are used for the DNS queries, which all have various tasks. Moreover, separate entries exist for different functions since we can set up mail servers and other servers for a domain.

| Record Type | Full Name                 | Description                                                                                                                                 | Zone File Example                                                                              |
| ----------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `A`         | Address Record            | Maps a hostname to its IPv4 address.                                                                                                        | `www.example.com.` IN A `192.0.2.1`                                                            |
| `AAAA`      | IPv6 Address Record       | Maps a hostname to its IPv6 address.                                                                                                        | `www.example.com.` IN AAAA `2001:db8:85a3::8a2e:370:7334`                                      |
| `CNAME`     | Canonical Name Record     | Creates an alias for a hostname, pointing it to another hostname.                                                                           | `blog.example.com.` IN CNAME `webserver.example.net.`                                          |
| `MX`        | Mail Exchange Record      | Specifies the mail server(s) responsible for handling email for the domain.                                                                 | `example.com.` IN MX 10 `mail.example.com.`                                                    |
| `NS`        | Name Server Record        | Delegates a DNS zone to a specific authoritative name server.                                                                               | `example.com.` IN NS `ns1.example.com.`                                                        |
| `TXT`       | Text Record               | Stores arbitrary text information, often used for domain verification or security policies.                                                 | `example.com.` IN TXT `"v=spf1 mx -all"` (SPF record)                                          |
| `SOA`       | Start of Authority Record | Specifies administrative information about a DNS zone, including the primary name server, responsible person's email, and other parameters. | `example.com.` IN SOA `ns1.example.com. admin.example.com. 2024060301 10800 3600 604800 86400` |
| `SRV`       | Service Record            | Defines the hostname and port number for specific services.                                                                                 | `_sip._udp.example.com.` IN SRV 10 5 5060 `sipserver.example.com.`                             |
| `PTR`       | Pointer Record            | Used for reverse DNS lookups, mapping an IP address to a hostname.                                                                          | `1.2.0.192.in-addr.arpa.` IN PTR `www.example.com.`                                            |

The `SOA` record is located in a domain's zone file and specifies who is responsible for the operation of the domain and how DNS information for the domain is managed.
