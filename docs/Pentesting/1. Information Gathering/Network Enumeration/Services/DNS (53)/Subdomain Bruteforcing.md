There are several tools available that excel at brute-force enumeration:

| Tool                                                    | Description                                                                                                                     |

```shell-session
arenwald@htb[/htb]$ for sub in $(cat /opt/useful/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-110000.txt);do dig $sub.inlanefreight.htb @10.129.14.128 | grep -v ';\|SOA' | sed -r '/^\s*$/d' | grep $sub | tee -a subdomains.txt;done

ns.inlanefreight.htb.   604800  IN      A       10.129.34.136
mail1.inlanefreight.htb. 604800 IN      A       10.129.18.201
app.inlanefreight.htb.  604800  IN      A       10.129.18.15
```

Many different tools can be used for this, and most of them work in the same way. One of these tools is, for example [DNSenum](https://github.com/fwaeytens/dnsenum).

```shell-session
arenwald@htb[/htb]$ dnsenum --dnsserver 10.129.14.128 --enum -p 0 -s 0 -o subdomains.txt -f /opt/useful/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-110000.txt inlanefreight.htb
