There are many different security-related settings we can make on each FTP server. These can have various purposes, such as testing connections through the firewalls, testing routes, and authentication mechanisms. One of these authentication mechanisms is the `anonymous` user. This is often used to allow everyone on the internal network to share files and data without accessing each other's computers. With vsFTPd, the [optional settings](http://vsftpd.beasts.org/vsftpd_conf.html) that can be added to the configuration file for the anonymous login look like this:

|**Setting**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`anonymous_enable=YES`|Allowing anonymous login?|
|`anon_upload_enable=YES`|Allowing anonymous to upload files?|
|`anon_mkdir_write_enable=YES`|Allowing anonymous to create new directories?|
|`no_anon_password=YES`|Do not ask anonymous for password?|
|`anon_root=/home/username/ftp`|Directory for anonymous.|
|`write_enable=YES`|Allow the usage of FTP commands: STOR, DELE, RNFR, RNTO, MKD, RMD, APPE, and SITE?|

With the standard FTP client (`ftp`), we can access the FTP server accordingly and log in with the anonymous user if the settings shown above have been used. The use of the anonymous account can occur in internal environments and infrastructures where the participants are all known. Access to this type of service can be set temporarily or with the setting to accelerate the exchange of files.

As soon as we connect to the vsFTPd server, the `response code 220` is displayed with the banner of the FTP server. Often this banner contains the description of the `service` and even the `version` of it. It also tells us what type of system the FTP server is. One of the most common configurations of FTP servers is to allow `anonymous` access, which does not require legitimate credentials but provides access to some files. Even if we cannot download them, sometimes just listing the contents is enough to generate further ideas and note down information that will help us in another approach.

#### Anonymous Login

```shell-session
arenwald@htb[/htb]$ ftp 10.129.14.136

Connected to 10.129.14.136.
220 "Welcome to the HTB Academy vsFTP service."
Name (10.129.14.136:cry0l1t3): anonymous

230 Login successful.
Remote system type is UNIX.
Using binary mode to transfer files.


ftp> ls

200 PORT command successful. Consider using PASV.
150 Here comes the directory listing.
-rw-rw-r--    1 1002     1002      8138592 Sep 14 16:54 Calender.pptx
drwxrwxr-x    2 1002     1002         4096 Sep 14 16:50 Clients
drwxrwxr-x    2 1002     1002         4096 Sep 14 16:50 Documents
drwxrwxr-x    2 1002     1002         4096 Sep 14 16:50 Employees
-rw-rw-r--    1 1002     1002           41 Sep 14 16:45 Important Notes.txt
226 Directory send OK.

```

However, to get the first overview of the server's settings, we can use the following command:

#### vsFTPd Status

```shell-session
ftp> status

Connected to 10.129.14.136.
No proxy connection.
Connecting using address family: any.
Mode: stream; Type: binary; Form: non-print; Structure: file
Verbose: on; Bell: off; Prompting: on; Globbing: on
Store unique: off; Receive unique: off
Case: off; CR stripping: on
Quote control characters: on
Ntrans: off
Nmap: off
Hash mark printing: off; Use of PORT cmds: on
Tick counter printing: off
```

Some commands should be used occasionally, as these will make the server show us more information that we can use for our purposes. These commands include `debug` and `trace`.

#### vsFTPd Detailed Output

```shell-session
ftp> debug

Debugging on (debug=1).


ftp> trace

Packet tracing on.


ftp> ls

---> PORT 10,10,14,4,188,195
200 PORT command successful. Consider using PASV.
---> LIST
150 Here comes the directory listing.
-rw-rw-r--    1 1002     1002      8138592 Sep 14 16:54 Calender.pptx
drwxrwxr-x    2 1002     1002         4096 Sep 14 17:03 Clients
drwxrwxr-x    2 1002     1002         4096 Sep 14 16:50 Documents

226 Directory send OK.
```

|**Setting**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`dirmessage_enable=YES`|Show a message when they first enter a new directory?|
|`chown_uploads=YES`|Change ownership of anonymously uploaded files?|
|`chown_username=username`|User who is given ownership of anonymously uploaded files.|
|`local_enable=YES`|Enable local users to login?|
|`chroot_local_user=YES`|Place local users into their home directory?|
|`chroot_list_enable=YES`|Use a list of local users that will be placed in their home directory?|

|**Setting**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`hide_ids=YES`|All user and group information in directory listings will be displayed as "ftp".|
|`ls_recurse_enable=YES`|Allows the use of recurse listings.|

In the following example, we can see that if the `hide_ids=YES` setting is present, the UID and GUID representation of the service will be overwritten, making it more difficult for us to identify with which rights these files are written and uploaded.

#### Hiding IDs - YES

```shell-session
ftp> ls

---> TYPE A
200 Switching to ASCII mode.
ftp: setsockopt (ignored): Permission denied
---> PORT 10,10,14,4,223,101

226 Directory send OK.
```

This setting is a security feature to prevent local usernames from being revealed. With the usernames, we could attack the services like FTP and SSH and many others with a brute-force attack in theory. However, in reality, [fail2ban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fail2ban) solutions are now a standard implementation of any infrastructure that logs the IP address and blocks all access to the infrastructure after a certain number of failed login attempts.

Another helpful setting we can use for our purposes is the `ls_recurse_enable=YES`. This is often set on the vsFTPd server to have a better overview of the FTP directory structure, as it allows us to see all the visible content at once.

#### Recursive Listing

```shell-session
ftp> ls -R

---> PORT 10,10,14,4,222,149
200 PORT command successful. Consider using PASV.

`Downloading` files from such an FTP server is one of the main features, as well as `uploading` files created by us. This allows us, for example, to use LFI vulnerabilities to make the host execute system commands. Apart from the files, we can view, download and inspect. Attacks are also possible with the FTP logs, leading to `Remote Command Execution` (`RCE`). This applies to the FTP services and all those we can detect during our enumeration phase.

#### Download a File

```shell-session
ftp> ls

200 PORT command successful. Consider using PASV.
150 Here comes the directory listing.

ftp> exit

221 Goodbye.
```

```shell-session
arenwald@htb[/htb]$ ls | grep Notes.txt

'Important Notes.txt'
```

We also can download all the files and folders we have access to at once. This is especially useful if the FTP server has many different files in a larger folder structure. However, this can cause alarms because no one from the company usually wants to download all files and content all at once.

#### Download All Available Files

```shell-session

Once we have downloaded all the files, `wget` will create a directory with the name of the IP address of our target. All downloaded files are stored there, which we can then inspect locally.

Next, we can check if we have the permissions to upload files to the FTP server. Especially with web servers, it is common that files are synchronized, and the developers have quick access to the files. FTP is often used for this purpose, and most of the time, configuration errors are found on servers that the administrators think are not discoverable. The attitude that internal network components cannot be accessed from the outside means that the hardening of internal systems is often neglected and leads to misconfigurations.

The ability to upload files to the FTP server connected to a web server increases the likelihood of gaining direct access to the webserver and even a reverse shell that allows us to execute internal system commands and perhaps even escalate our privileges.

#### Upload a File

```shell-session
arenwald@htb[/htb]$ touch testupload.txt
```

With the `PUT` command, we can upload files in the current folder to the FTP server.

```shell-session
ftp> put testupload.txt 

local: testupload.txt remote: testupload.txt
