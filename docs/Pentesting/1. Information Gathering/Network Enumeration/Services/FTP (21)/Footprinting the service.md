Footprinting using various network scanners is also a handy and widespread approach. These tools make it easier for us to identify different services, even if they are not accessible on standard ports. One of the most widely used tools for this purpose is Nmap. Nmap also brings the [Nmap Scripting Engine](https://nmap.org/book/nse.html) (`NSE`), a set of many different scripts written for specific services. More information on the capabilities of Nmap and NSE can be found in the [Network Enumeration with Nmap](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/network-enumeration-with-nmap) module. We can update this database of NSE scripts with the command shown.

#### Nmap FTP Scripts

```shell-session
arenwald@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap --script-updatedb

Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-09-19 13:49 CEST
NSE: Updating rule database.
NSE: Script Database updated successfully.
Nmap done: 0 IP addresses (0 hosts up) scanned in 0.28 seconds
```

All the NSE scripts are located on the Pwnbox in `/usr/share/nmap/scripts/`, but on our systems, we can find them using a simple command on our system.

```shell-session
arenwald@htb[/htb]$ find / -type f -name ftp* 2>/dev/null | grep scripts

/usr/share/nmap/scripts/ftp-syst.nse
/usr/share/nmap/scripts/ftp-vsftpd-backdoor.nse
/usr/share/nmap/scripts/ftp-vuln-cve2010-4221.nse
/usr/share/nmap/scripts/ftp-proftpd-backdoor.nse
/usr/share/nmap/scripts/ftp-bounce.nse
/usr/share/nmap/scripts/ftp-libopie.nse
/usr/share/nmap/scripts/ftp-anon.nse
/usr/share/nmap/scripts/ftp-brute.nse
```

As we already know, the FTP server usually runs on the standard TCP port 21, which we can scan using Nmap. We also use the version scan (`-sV`), aggressive scan (`-A`), and the default script scan (`-sC`) against our target `10.129.14.136`.

#### Nmap

```shell-session
arenwald@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap -sV -p21 -sC -A 10.129.14.136

The default script scan is based on the services' fingerprints, responses, and standard ports. Once Nmap has detected the service, it executes the marked scripts one after the other, providing different information. For example, the [ftp-anon](https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/ftp-anon.html) NSE script checks whether the FTP server allows anonymous access. If so, the contents of the FTP root directory are rendered for the anonymous user.

The `ftp-syst`, for example, executes the `STAT` command, which displays information about the FTP server status. This includes configurations as well as the version of the FTP server. Nmap also provides the ability to trace the progress of NSE scripts at the network level if we use the `--script-trace` option in our scans. This lets us see what commands Nmap sends, what ports are used, and what responses we receive from the scanned server.

#### Nmap Script Trace

```

The scan history shows that four different parallel scans are running against the service, with various timeouts. For the NSE scripts, we see that our local machine uses other output ports (`54226`, `54228`, `54230`, `54232`) and first initiates the connection with the `CONNECT` command. From the first response from the server, we can see that we are receiving the banner from the server to our second NSE script (`54228`) from the target FTP server. If necessary, we can, of course, use other applications such as `netcat` or `telnet` to interact with the FTP server.

#### Service Interaction

```shell-session
arenwald@htb[/htb]$ nc -nv 10.129.14.136 21
```

```shell-session
arenwald@htb[/htb]$ telnet 10.129.14.136 21
```

It looks slightly different if the FTP server runs with TLS/SSL encryption. Because then we need a client that can handle TLS/SSL. For this, we can use the client `openssl` and communicate with the FTP server. The good thing about using `openssl` is that we can see the SSL certificate, which can also be helpful.

```shell-session
arenwald@htb[/htb]$ openssl s_client -connect 10.129.14.136:21 -starttls ftp

CONNECTED(00000003)

This is because the SSL certificate allows us to recognize the `hostname`, for example, and in most cases also an `email address` for the organization or company. In addition, if the company has several locations worldwide, certificates can also be created for specific locations, which can also be identified using the SSL certificate.
