If default credentials do not work to access a BMC, we can turn to a [flaw](http://fish2.com/ipmi/remote-pw-cracking.html) in the RAKP protocol in IPMI 2.0. During the authentication process, the server sends a salted SHA1 or MD5 hash of the user's password to the client before authentication takes place. This can be leveraged to obtain the password hash for ANY valid user account on the BMC. These password hashes can then be cracked offline using a dictionary attack using `Hashcat` mode `7300`. In the event of an HP iLO using a factory default password, we can use this Hashcat mask attack command `hashcat -m 7300 ipmi.txt -a 3 ?1?1?1?1?1?1?1?1 -1 ?d?u` which tries all combinations of upper case letters and numbers for an eight-character password.

There is no direct "fix" to this issue because the flaw is a critical component of the IPMI specification. Clients can opt for very long, difficult to crack passwords or implement network segmentation rules to restrict the direct access to the BMCs. It is important to not overlook IPMI during internal penetration tests (we see it during most assessments) because not only can we often gain access to the BMC web console, which is a high-risk finding, but we have seen environments where a unique (but crackable) password is set that is later re-used across other systems. On one such penetration test, we obtained an IPMI hash, cracked it offline using Hashcat, and were able to SSH into many critical servers in the environment as the root user and gain access to web management consoles for various network monitoring tools.

To retrieve IPMI hashes, we can use the Metasploit [IPMI 2.0 RAKP Remote SHA1 Password Hash Retrieval](https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/auxiliary/scanner/ipmi/ipmi_dumphashes/) module.

[+] 10.129.42.195:623 - IPMI - Hash for user 'ADMIN' matches password 'ADMIN'
[*] Scanned 1 of 1 hosts (100% complete)
[*] Auxiliary module execution completed
```

Here we can see that we have successfully obtained the password hash for the user `ADMIN`, and the tool was able to quickly crack it to reveal what appears to be a default password `ADMIN`. From here, we could attempt to log in to the BMC, or, if the password were something more unique, check for password re-use on other systems. IPMI is very common in network environments since sysadmins need to be able to access servers remotely in the event of an outage or perform certain maintenance tasks that they would traditionally have had to be physically in front of the server to complete. This ease of administration comes with the risk of exposing password hashes to anyone on the network and can lead to unauthorized access, system disruption, and even remote code execution. Checking for IPMI should be part of our internal penetration test playbook for any environment we find ourselves assessing.
