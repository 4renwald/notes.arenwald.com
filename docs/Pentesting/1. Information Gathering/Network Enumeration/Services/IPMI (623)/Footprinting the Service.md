IPMI communicates over port 623 UDP. Systems that use the IPMI protocol are called Baseboard Management Controllers (BMCs). BMCs are typically implemented as embedded ARM systems running Linux, and connected directly to the host's motherboard. BMCs are built into many motherboards but can also be added to a system as a PCI card. Most servers either come with a BMC or support adding a BMC. The most common BMCs we often see during internal penetration tests are HP iLO, Dell DRAC, and Supermicro IPMI. If we can access a BMC during an assessment, we would gain full access to the host motherboard and be able to monitor, reboot, power off, or even reinstall the host operating system. Gaining access to a BMC is nearly equivalent to physical access to a system. Many BMCs (including HP iLO, Dell DRAC, and Supermicro IPMI) expose a web-based management console, some sort of command-line remote access protocol such as Telnet or SSH, and the port 623 UDP, which, again, is for the IPMI network protocol. Below is a sample Nmap scan using the Nmap [ipmi-version](https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/ipmi-version.html) NSE script to footprint the service.

#### Nmap

```shell-session
arenwald@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap -sU --script ipmi-version -p 623 ilo.inlanfreight.local

Starting Nmap 7.92 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-11-04 21:48 GMT
Nmap scan report for ilo.inlanfreight.local (172.16.2.2)
Host is up (0.00064s latency).

```

Here, we can see that the IPMI protocol is indeed listening on port 623, and Nmap has fingerprinted version 2.0 of the protocol. We can also use the Metasploit scanner module [IPMI Information Discovery (auxiliary/scanner/ipmi/ipmi_version)](https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/auxiliary/scanner/ipmi/ipmi_version/).

#### Metasploit Version Scan

```shell-session

msf6 auxiliary(scanner/ipmi/ipmi_version) > set rhosts 10.129.42.195
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/ipmi/ipmi_version) > show options

During internal penetration tests, we often find BMCs where the administrators have not changed the default password. Some unique default passwords to keep in our cheatsheets include:

|Product|Username|Password|
|---|---|---|
|Dell iDRAC|root|calvin|
|HP iLO|Administrator|randomized 8-character string consisting of numbers and uppercase letters|
|Supermicro IPMI|ADMIN|ADMIN|

It is also essential to try out known default passwords for ANY services that we discover, as these are often left unchanged and can lead to quick wins. When dealing with BMCs, these default passwords may gain us access to the web console or even command line access via SSH or Telnet.
