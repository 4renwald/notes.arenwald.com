#### MSSQL Clients

[SQL Server Management Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver15) (`SSMS`) comes as a feature that can be installed with the MSSQL install package or can be downloaded & installed separately. It is commonly installed on the server for initial configuration and long-term management of databases by admins. Keep in mind that since SSMS is a client-side application, it can be installed and used on any system an admin or developer is planning to manage the database from. It doesn't only exist on the server hosting the database. This means we could come across a vulnerable system with SSMS with saved credentials that allow us to connect to the database. The image below shows SSMS in action.

Many other clients can be used to access a database running on MSSQL. Including but not limited to:

|[mssql-cli](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/tools/mssql-cli?view=sql-server-ver15)|[SQL Server PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/powershell/sql-server-powershell?view=sql-server-ver15)|[HeidiSQL](https://www.heidisql.com)|[SQLPro](https://www.macsqlclient.com)|[Impacket's mssqlclient.py](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/mssqlclient.py)|

Of the MSSQL clients listed above, pentesters may find Impacket's mssqlclient.py to be the most useful due to SecureAuthCorp's Impacket project being present on many pentesting distributions at install. To find if and where the client is located on our host, we can use the following command:

```shell-session
arenwald@htb[/htb]$ locate mssqlclient

/usr/bin/impacket-mssqlclient
/usr/share/doc/python3-impacket/examples/mssqlclient.py
```
