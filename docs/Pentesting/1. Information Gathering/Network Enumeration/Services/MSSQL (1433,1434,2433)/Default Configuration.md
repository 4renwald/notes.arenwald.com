When an admin initially installs and configures MSSQL to be network accessible, the SQL service will likely run as `NT SERVICE\MSSQLSERVER`. Connecting from the client-side is possible through Windows Authentication, and by default, encryption is not enforced when attempting to connect.

Authentication being set to `Windows Authentication` means that the underlying Windows OS will process the login request and use either the local SAM database or the domain controller (hosting Active Directory) before allowing connectivity to the database management system. Using Active Directory can be ideal for auditing activity and controlling access in a Windows environment, but if an account is compromised, it could lead to privilege escalation and lateral movement across a Windows domain environment. Like with any OS, service, server role, or application, it can be beneficial to set it up in a VM from installation to configuration to understand all the default configurations and potential mistakes that the administrator could make.
