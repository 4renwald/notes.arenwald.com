Many things can be misconfigured with MySQL. We can look in more detail at the [MySQL reference](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-system-variables.html) to determine which options can be made in the server configuration. The main options that are security-relevant are:

|**Settings**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`user`|Sets which user the MySQL service will run as.|
|`password`|Sets the password for the MySQL user.|
|`admin_address`|The IP address on which to listen for TCP/IP connections on the administrative network interface.|
|`debug`|This variable indicates the current debugging settings|
|`sql_warnings`|This variable controls whether single-row INSERT statements produce an information string if warnings occur.|
|`secure_file_priv`|This variable is used to limit the effect of data import and export operations.|

The settings `user`, `password`, and `admin_address` are security-relevant because the entries are made in plain text. Often, the rights for the configuration file of the MySQL server are not assigned correctly. If we get another way to read files or even a shell, we can see the file and the username and password for the MySQL server. Suppose there are no other security measures to prevent unauthorized access. In that case, the entire database and all the existing customers' information, email addresses, passwords, and personal data can be viewed and even edited.

The `debug` and `sql_warnings` settings provide verbose information output in case of errors, which are essential for the administrator but should not be seen by others. This information often contains sensitive content, which could be detected by trial and error to identify further attack possibilities. These error messages are often displayed directly on web applications. Accordingly, the SQL injections could be manipulated even to have the MySQL server execute system commands. This is discussed and shown in the module [SQL Injection Fundamentals](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/sql-injection-fundamentals) and [SQLMap Essentials](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/sqlmap-essentials).
