The management of SQL databases and their configurations is a vast topic. It is so large that entire professions, such as `database administrator`, deal with almost nothing but databases. These structures become very large quickly, and their planning can become complicated. Among other things, DB management is a core competency for `software developers` but also `information security analysts`. To cover this area completely would go beyond the scope of this module. Therefore, we recommend setting up a MySQL/MariaDB instance to experiment with the various configurations to understand the available functionality and configuration options better. Let us have a look at the default configuration of MySQL.

#### Default Configuration

```shell-session
arenwald@htb[/htb]$ sudo apt install mysql-server -y
arenwald@htb[/htb]$ cat /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf | grep -v "#" | sed -r '/^\s*$/d'

[client]
port		= 3306
socket		= /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock

[mysqld_safe]
pid-file	= /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.pid
socket		= /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock
nice		= 0

[mysqld]
skip-host-cache
skip-name-resolve
user		= mysql
pid-file	= /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.pid
socket		= /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock
port		= 3306
basedir		= /usr
datadir		= /var/lib/mysql
tmpdir		= /tmp
lc-messages-dir	= /usr/share/mysql
explicit_defaults_for_timestamp

symbolic-links=0

!includedir /etc/mysql/conf.d/
```
