`MySQL` is an open-source SQL relational database management system developed and supported by Oracle. A database is simply a structured collection of data organized for easy use and retrieval. The database system can quickly process large amounts of data with high performance. Within the database, data storage is done in a manner to take up as little space as possible. The database is controlled using the [SQL database language](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_intro.asp). MySQL works according to the `client-server principle` and consists of a MySQL server and one or more MySQL clients. The MySQL server is the actual database management system. It takes care of data storage and distribution. The data is stored in tables with different columns, rows, and data types. These databases are often stored in a single file with the file extension `.sql`, for example, like `wordpress.sql`.

#### MySQL Clients

The MySQL clients can retrieve and edit the data using structured queries to the database engine. Inserting, deleting, modifying, and retrieving data, is done using the SQL database language. Therefore, MySQL is suitable for managing many different databases to which clients can send multiple queries simultaneously. Depending on the use of the database, access is possible via an internal network or the public Internet.

One of the best examples of database usage is the CMS WordPress. WordPress stores all created posts, usernames, and passwords in their own database, which is only accessible from the localhost. However, as explained in more detail in the module [Introduction to Web Applications](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/introduction-to-web-applications), there are database structures that are distributed across multiple servers also.

#### MySQL Databases

MySQL is ideally suited for applications such as `dynamic websites`, where efficient syntax and high response speed are essential. It is often combined with a Linux OS, PHP, and an Apache web server and is also known in this combination as [LAMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)) (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP), or when using Nginx, as [LEMP](https://lemp.io/). In a web hosting with MySQL database, this serves as a central instance in which content required by PHP scripts is stored. Among these are:

|||||
|---|---|---|---|
|Headers|Texts|Meta tags|Forms|
|Customers|Usernames|Administrators|Moderators|
|Email addresses|User information|Permissions|Passwords|
|External/Internal links|Links to Files|Specific contents|Values|

Sensitive data such as passwords can be stored in their plain-text form by MySQL; however, they are generally encrypted beforehand by the PHP scripts using secure methods such as [One-Way-Encryption](https://en.citizendium.org/wiki/One-way_encryption).

#### MySQL Commands

A MySQL database translates the commands internally into executable code and performs the requested actions. The web application informs the user if an error occurs during processing, which various `SQL injections` can provoke. Often, these error descriptions contain important information and confirm, among other things, that the web application interacts with the database in a different way than the developers intended.

The web application sends the generated information back to the client if the data is processed correctly. This information can be the data extracts from a table or records needed for further processing with logins, search functions, etc. SQL commands can display, modify, add or delete rows in tables. In addition, SQL can also change the structure of tables, create or delete relationships and indexes, and manage users.

`MariaDB`, which is often connected with MySQL, is a fork of the original MySQL code. This is because the chief developer of MySQL left the company `MySQL AB` after it was acquired by `Oracle` and developed another open-source SQL database management system based on the source code of MySQL and called it MariaDB.
