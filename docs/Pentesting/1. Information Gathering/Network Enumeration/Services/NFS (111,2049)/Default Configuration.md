NFS is not difficult to configure because there are not as many options as FTP or SMB have. The `/etc/exports` file contains a table of physical filesystems on an NFS server accessible by the clients. The [NFS Exports Table](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/man5/exports.5.html) shows which options it accepts and thus indicates which options are available to us.

#### Exports File

```shell-session
arenwald@htb[/htb]$ cat /etc/exports 

# /etc/exports: the access control list for filesystems which may be exported
#               to NFS clients.  See exports(5).
#
# Example for NFSv2 and NFSv3:
# /srv/homes       hostname1(rw,sync,no_subtree_check) hostname2(ro,sync,no_subtree_check)
#
# Example for NFSv4:
# /srv/nfs4        gss/krb5i(rw,sync,fsid=0,crossmnt,no_subtree_check)
# /srv/nfs4/homes  gss/krb5i(rw,sync,no_subtree_check)
```

The default `exports` file also contains some examples of configuring NFS shares. First, the folder is specified and made available to others, and then the rights they will have on this NFS share are connected to a host or a subnet. Finally, additional options can be added to the hosts or subnets.

|**Option**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`rw`|Read and write permissions.|
|`ro`|Read only permissions.|
|`sync`|Synchronous data transfer. (A bit slower)|
|`async`|Asynchronous data transfer. (A bit faster)|
|`secure`|Ports above 1024 will not be used.|
|`insecure`|Ports above 1024 will be used.|
|`no_subtree_check`|This option disables the checking of subdirectory trees.|
|`root_squash`|Assigns all permissions to files of root UID/GID 0 to the UID/GID of anonymous, which prevents `root` from accessing files on an NFS mount.|

Let us create such an entry for test purposes and play around with the settings.

#### ExportFS

```shell-session
root@nfs:~# echo '/mnt/nfs  10.129.14.0/24(sync,no_subtree_check)' >> /etc/exports
root@nfs:~# systemctl restart nfs-kernel-server 
root@nfs:~# exportfs

/mnt/nfs      	10.129.14.0/24
```

We have shared the folder `/mnt/nfs` to the subnet `10.129.14.0/24` with the setting shown above. This means that all hosts on the network will be able to mount this NFS share and inspect the contents of this folder.
