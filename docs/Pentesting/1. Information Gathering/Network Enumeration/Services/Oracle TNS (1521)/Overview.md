The `Oracle Transparent Network Substrate` (`TNS`) server is a communication protocol that facilitates communication between Oracle databases and applications over networks. Initially introduced as part of the [Oracle Net Services](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/18/netag/introducing-oracle-net-services.html) software suite, TNS supports various networking protocols between Oracle databases and client applications, such as `IPX/SPX` and `TCP/IP` protocol stacks. As a result, it has become a preferred solution for managing large, complex databases in the healthcare, finance, and retail industries. In addition, its built-in encryption mechanism ensures the security of data transmitted, making it an ideal solution for enterprise environments where data security is paramount.

Over time, TNS has been updated to support newer technologies, including `IPv6` and `SSL/TLS` encryption which makes it more suitable for the following purposes:

Furthermore, it enables encryption between client and server communication through an additional layer of security over the TCP/IP protocol layer. This feature helps secure the database architecture from unauthorized access or attacks that attempt to compromise the data on the network traffic. Besides, it provides advanced tools and capabilities for database administrators and developers since it offers comprehensive performance monitoring and analysis tools, error reporting and logging capabilities, workload management, and fault tolerance through database services.
