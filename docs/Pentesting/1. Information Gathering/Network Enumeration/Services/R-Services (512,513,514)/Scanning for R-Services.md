#### Access Control & Trusted Relationships

The primary concern for `r-services`, and one of the primary reasons `SSH` was introduced to replace it, is the inherent issues regarding access control for these protocols. R-services rely on trusted information sent from the remote client to the host machine they are attempting to authenticate to. By default, these services utilize [Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM)](https://debathena.mit.edu/trac/wiki/PAM) for user authentication onto a remote system; however, they also bypass this authentication through the use of the `/etc/hosts.equiv` and `.rhosts` files on the system. The `hosts.equiv` and `.rhosts` files contain a list of hosts (`IPs` or `Hostnames`) and users that are `trusted` by the local host when a connection attempt is made using `r-commands`. Entries in either file can appear like the following:

**Note:** The `hosts.equiv` file is recognized as the global configuration regarding all users on a system, whereas `.rhosts` provides a per-user configuration.

#### Sample .rhosts File

```shell-session
arenwald@htb[/htb]$ cat .rhosts

htb-student     10.0.17.5
+               10.0.17.10
+               +
```

As we can see from this example, both files follow the specific syntax of `<username> <ip address>` or `<username> <hostname>` pairs. Additionally, the `+` modifier can be used within these files as a wildcard to specify anything. In this example, the `+` modifier allows any external user to access r-commands from the `htb-student` user account via the host with the IP address `10.0.17.10`.

Misconfigurations in either of these files can allow an attacker to authenticate as another user without credentials, with the potential for gaining code execution. Now that we understand how we can potentially abuse misconfigurations in these files let's attempt to try logging into a target host using `rlogin`.

#### Logging in Using Rlogin

```shell-session
arenwald@htb[/htb]$ rlogin 10.0.17.2 -l htb-student

Last login: Fri Dec  2 16:11:21 from localhost

[htb-student@localhost ~]$
```

We have successfully logged in under the `htb-student` account on the remote host due to the misconfigurations in the `.rhosts` file. Once successfully logged in, we can also abuse the `rwho` command to list all interactive sessions on the local network by sending requests to the UDP port 513.

#### Listing Authenticated Users Using Rwho

```shell-session
arenwald@htb[/htb]$ rwho

root     web01:pts/0 Dec  2 21:34
htb-student     workstn01:tty1  Dec  2 19:57  2:25       
```

From this information, we can see that the `htb-student` user is currently authenticated to the `workstn01` host, whereas the `root` user is authenticated to the `web01` host. We can use this to our advantage when scoping out potential usernames to use during further attacks on hosts over the network. However, the `rwho` daemon periodically broadcasts information about logged-on users, so it might be beneficial to watch the network traffic.

#### Listing Authenticated Users Using Rusers

To provide additional information in conjunction with `rwho`, we can issue the `rusers` command. This will give us a more detailed account of all logged-in users over the network, including information such as the username, hostname of the accessed machine, TTY that the user is logged in to, the date and time the user logged in, the amount of time since the user typed on the keyboard, and the remote host they logged in from (if applicable).

```shell-session
arenwald@htb[/htb]$ rusers -al 10.0.17.5

htb-student     10.0.17.5:console          Dec 2 19:57     2:25
```

As we can see, R-services are less frequently used nowadays due to their inherent security flaws and the availability of more secure protocols such as SSH. To be a well-rounded information security professional, we must have a broad and deep understanding of many systems, applications, protocols, etc. So, file away this knowledge about R-services because you never know when you may encounter them.
