Some of the above settings already bring some sensitive options. However, suppose we question the settings listed below and ask ourselves what the employees could gain from them, as well as attackers. In that case, we will see what advantages and disadvantages the settings bring with them. Let us take the setting `browseable = yes` as an example. If we as administrators adopt this setting, the company's employees will have the comfort of being able to look at the individual folders with the contents. Many folders are eventually used for better organization and structure. If the employee can browse through the shares, the attacker will also be able to do so after successful access.

| **Setting**                 | **Description**                                                     |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `browseable = yes`          | Allow listing available shares in the current share?                |
| `read only = no`            | Forbid the creation and modification of files?                      |
| `writable = yes`            | Allow users to create and modify files?                             |
| `guest ok = yes`            | Allow connecting to the service without using a password?           |
| `enable privileges = yes`   | Honor privileges assigned to specific SID?                          |
| `create mask = 0777`        | What permissions must be assigned to the newly created files?       |
| `directory mask = 0777`     | What permissions must be assigned to the newly created directories? |
| `logon script = script.sh`  | What script needs to be executed on the user's login?               |
| `magic script = script.sh`  | Which script should be executed when the script gets closed?        |
| `magic output = script.out` | Where the output of the magic script needs to be stored?            |
Let us create a share called `[notes]` and a few others and see how the settings affect our enumeration process. We will use all of the above settings and apply them to this share. For example, this setting is often applied, if only for testing purposes. If it is then an internal subnet of a small team in a large department, this setting is often retained or forgotten to be reset. This leads to the fact that we can browse through all the shares and, with high probability, even download and inspect them.

#### Example Share

```shell-session
...SNIP...

[notes]
	comment = CheckIT
	path = /mnt/notes/

	browseable = yes
	read only = no
	writable = yes
	guest ok = yes

	enable privileges = yes
	create mask = 0777
	directory mask = 0777
```

It is highly recommended to look at the man pages for Samba and configure it ourselves and experiment with the settings. We will then discover potential aspects that will be interesting for us as a penetration tester. In addition, the more familiar we become with the Samba server and SMB, the easier it will be to find our way around the environment and use it for our purposes. Once we have adjusted `/etc/samba/smb.conf` to our needs, we have to restart the service on the server.

#### Restart Samba

```shell-session
root@samba:~# sudo systemctl restart smbd
```

Now we can display a list (`-L`) of the server's shares with the `smbclient` command from our host. We use the so-called `null session` (`-N`), which is `anonymous` access without the input of existing users or valid passwords.

#### SMBclient - Connecting to the Share

```shell-session
arenwald@htb[/htb]$ smbclient -N -L //10.129.14.128

        Sharename       Type      Comment
        ---------       ----      -------
        print$          Disk      Printer Drivers
        home            Disk      INFREIGHT Samba
        dev             Disk      DEVenv
        notes           Disk      CheckIT
        IPC$            IPC       IPC Service (DEVSM)
SMB1 disabled -- no workgroup available
```

We can see that we now have five different shares on the Samba server from the result. Thereby `print$` and an `IPC$` are already included by default in the basic setting, as we have already seen. Since we deal with the `[notes]` share, let us log in and inspect it using the same client program. If we are not familiar with the client program, we can use the `help` command on successful login, listing all the possible commands we can execute.

```shell-session
arenwald@htb[/htb]$ smbclient //10.129.14.128/notes

Enter WORKGROUP\<username>'s password: 
Anonymous login successful
Try "help" to get a list of possible commands.

Once we have discovered interesting files or folders, we can download them using the `get` command. Smbclient also allows us to execute local system commands using an exclamation mark at the beginning (`!<cmd>`) without interrupting the connection.

#### Download Files from SMB

```shell-session
smb: \> get prep-prod.txt 

getting file \prep-prod.txt of size 71 as prep-prod.txt (8,7 KiloBytes/sec) 
(average 8,7 KiloBytes/sec)


smb: \> !ls

prep-prod.txt


smb: \> !cat prep-prod.txt

[] check your code with the templates
[] run code-assessment.py
[] â€¦	
```

From the administrative point of view, we can check these connections using `smbstatus`. Apart from the Samba version, we can also see who, from which host, and which share the client is connected. This is especially important once we have entered a subnet (perhaps even an isolated one) that the others can still access.

For example, with domain-level security, the samba server acts as a member of a Windows domain. Each domain has at least one domain controller, usually a Windows NT server providing password authentication. This domain controller provides the workgroup with a definitive password server. The domain controllers keep track of users and passwords in their own `NTDS.dit` and `Security Authentication Module` (`SAM`) and authenticate each user when they log in for the first time and wish to access another machine's share.

#### Samba Status

```shell-session
