To prevent the sent emails from being filtered by spam filters and not reaching the recipient, the sender can use a relay server that the recipient trusts. It is an SMTP server that is known and verified by all others. As a rule, the sender must authenticate himself to the relay server before using it.

Often, administrators have no overview of which IP ranges they have to allow. This results in a misconfiguration of the SMTP server that we will still often find in external and internal penetration tests. Therefore, they allow all IP addresses not to cause errors in the email traffic and thus not to disturb or unintentionally interrupt the communication with potential and current customers.

#### Open Relay Configuration

```shell-session
mynetworks = 0.0.0.0/0
```

With this setting, this SMTP server can send fake emails and thus initialize communication between multiple parties. Another attack possibility would be to spoof the email and read it.
