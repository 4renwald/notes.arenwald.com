Some dangerous settings that the administrator can make with SNMP are:

|**Settings**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`rwuser noauth`|Provides access to the full OID tree without authentication.|
|`rwcommunity <community string> <IPv4 address>`|Provides access to the full OID tree regardless of where the requests were sent from.|
|`rwcommunity6 <community string> <IPv6 address>`|Same access as with `rwcommunity` with the difference of using IPv6.|
