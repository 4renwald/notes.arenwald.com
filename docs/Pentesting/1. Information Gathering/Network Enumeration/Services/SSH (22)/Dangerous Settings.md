Despite the SSH protocol being one of the most secure protocols available today, some misconfigurations can still make the SSH server vulnerable to easy-to-execute attacks. Let us take a look at the following settings:

|**Setting**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`PasswordAuthentication yes`|Allows password-based authentication.|
|`PermitEmptyPasswords yes`|Allows the use of empty passwords.|
|`PermitRootLogin yes`|Allows to log in as the root user.|
|`Protocol 1`|Uses an outdated version of encryption.|
|`X11Forwarding yes`|Allows X11 forwarding for GUI applications.|
|`AllowTcpForwarding yes`|Allows forwarding of TCP ports.|
|`PermitTunnel`|Allows tunneling.|
|`DebianBanner yes`|Displays a specific banner when logging in.|

Allowing password authentication allows us to brute-force a known username for possible passwords. Many different methods can be used to guess the passwords of users. For this purpose, specific `patterns` are usually used to mutate the most commonly used passwords and, frighteningly, correct them. This is because we humans are lazy and do not want to remember complex and complicated passwords. Therefore, we create passwords that we can easily remember, and this leads to the fact that, for example, numbers or characters are added only at the end of the password. Believing that the password is secure, the mentioned patterns are used to guess precisely such "adjustments" of these passwords. However, some instructions and [hardening guides](https://www.ssh-audit.com/hardening_guides.html) can be used to harden our SSH servers.
