The [sshd_config](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/sshd_config) file, responsible for the OpenSSH server, has only a few of the settings configured by default. However, the default configuration includes X11 forwarding, which contained a command injection vulnerability in version 7.2p1 of OpenSSH in 2016. Nevertheless, we do not need a GUI to manage our servers.

#### Default Configuration

Linux Remote Management Protocols

```shell-session
arenwald@htb[/htb]$ cat /etc/ssh/sshd_config  | grep -v "#" | sed -r '/^\s*$/d'

Include /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/*.conf
ChallengeResponseAuthentication no
UsePAM yes
X11Forwarding yes
PrintMotd no
AcceptEnv LANG LC_*
Subsystem       sftp    /usr/lib/openssh/sftp-server
```

Most settings in this configuration file are commented out and require manual configuration.
