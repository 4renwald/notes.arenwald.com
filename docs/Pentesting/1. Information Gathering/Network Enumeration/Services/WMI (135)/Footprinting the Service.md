The initialization of the WMI communication always takes place on `TCP` port `135`, and after the successful establishment of the connection, the communication is moved to a random port. For example, the program [wmiexec.py](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/wmiexec.py) from the Impacket toolkit can be used for this.

#### WMIexec.py

```shell-session
arenwald@htb[/htb]$ /usr/share/doc/python3-impacket/examples/wmiexec.py Cry0l1t3:"P455w0rD!"@10.129.201.248 "hostname"

Again, it is necessary to mention that the knowledge gained from installing these services and playing around with the configurations on our own Windows Server VM for gaining experience and developing the functional principle and the administrator's point of view cannot be replaced by reading manuals. Therefore, we strongly recommend setting up your own Windows Server, experimenting with the settings, and scanning these services repeatedly to see the differences in the results.
