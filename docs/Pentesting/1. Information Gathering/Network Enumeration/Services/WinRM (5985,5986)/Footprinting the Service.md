As we already know, WinRM uses TCP ports `5985` (`HTTP`) and `5986` (`HTTPS`) by default, which we can scan using Nmap. However, often we will see that only HTTP (`TCP 5985`) is used instead of HTTPS (`TCP 5986`).

#### Nmap WinRM

```shell-session
arenwald@htb[/htb]$ nmap -sV -sC 10.129.201.248 -p5985,5986 --disable-arp-ping -n

If we want to find out whether one or more remote servers can be reached via WinRM, we can easily do this with the help of PowerShell. The [Test-WsMan](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.wsman.management/test-wsman?view=powershell-7.2) cmdlet is responsible for this, and the host's name in question is passed to it. In Linux-based environments, we can use the tool called [evil-winrm](https://github.com/Hackplayers/evil-winrm), another penetration testing tool designed to interact with WinRM.

```shell-session
arenwald@htb[/htb]$ evil-winrm -i 10.129.201.248 -u Cry0l1t3 -p P455w0rD!
