### Subdomain Brute-Forcing

Subdomain brute-forcing is a proactive technique used in web reconnaissance to uncover subdomains that may not be readily apparent through passive methods. It involves systematically generating many potential subdomain names and testing them against the target's DNS server to see if they exist. This approach can unveil hidden subdomains that may host valuable information, development servers, or vulnerable applications.

One of the most versatile tools for subdomain brute-forcing is `dnsenum`. This powerful command-line tool combines various DNS enumeration techniques, including dictionary-based brute-forcing, to uncover subdomains associated with your target.

To use `dnsenum` for subdomain brute-forcing, you'll typically provide it with the target domain and a wordlist containing potential subdomain names. The tool will then systematically query the DNS server for each potential subdomain and report any that exist.

For example, the following command would attempt to brute-force subdomains of `example.com` using a wordlist named `subdomains.txt`:


```bash
dnsenum example.com -f subdomains.txt
```

### Virtual Hosts

Virtual hosting is a technique that allows multiple websites to share a single IP address. Each website is associated with a unique hostname, which is used to direct incoming requests to the correct site. This can be a cost-effective way for organizations to host multiple websites on a single server, but it can also create a challenge for web reconnaissance.

Since multiple websites share the same IP address, simply scanning the IP won't reveal all the hosted sites. You need a tool that can test different hostnames against the IP address to see which ones respond.

Several tools are available to aid in the discovery of virtual hosts:

|Tool|Description|Features|
|---|---|---|
|[gobuster](https://github.com/OJ/gobuster)|A multi-purpose tool often used for directory/file brute-forcing, but also effective for virtual host discovery.|Fast, supports multiple HTTP methods, can use custom wordlists.|
|[Feroxbuster](https://github.com/epi052/feroxbuster)|Similar to Gobuster, but with a Rust-based implementation, known for its speed and flexibility.|Supports recursion, wildcard discovery, and various filters.|
|[ffuf](https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf)|Another fast web fuzzer that can be used for virtual host discovery by fuzzing the `Host` header.|Customizable wordlist input and filtering options.|

## Gobuster

Gobuster is a versatile tool that can be used for various types of brute-forcing, including virtual host discovery. Its `vhost` mode is designed to enumerate virtual hosts by sending requests to the target IP address with different hostnames. If a virtual host is configured for a specific hostname, Gobuster will receive a response from the web server.

To use Gobuster to brute-force virtual hosts, you'll need a wordlist containing potential hostnames. Here's an example command:


```bash
gobuster vhost -u http://192.0.2.1 -w hostnames.txt
```

In this example, `-u` specifies the target IP address, and `-w` specifies the wordlist file. Gobuster will then systematically try each hostname in the wordlist and report any that results in a valid response from the web server.
#### Subdomain

`gobuster dns -d inlanefreight.com -w /usr/share/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/namelist.txt`

#### Vhosts
The `gobuster` command to bruteforce vhosts generally looks like this:

```shell-session
arenwald@htb[/htb]$ gobuster vhost -u http://<target_IP_address> -w <wordlist_file> --append-domain
```

- The `-u` flag specifies the target URL (replace `<target_IP_address>` with the actual IP).
- The `-w` flag specifies the wordlist file (replace `<wordlist_file>` with the path to your wordlist).
- The `--append-domain` flag appends the base domain to each word in the wordlist.
