Certificate Transparency (CT) logs offer a treasure trove of subdomain information for passive reconnaissance. These publicly accessible logs record SSL/TLS certificates issued for domains and their subdomains, serving as a security measure to prevent fraudulent certificates. For reconnaissance, they offer a window into potentially overlooked subdomains.

The `crt.sh` website provides a searchable interface for CT logs. To efficiently extract subdomains using `crt.sh` within your terminal, you can use a command like this:

Code: bash

```bash
curl -s "https://crt.sh/?q=%25.example.com&output=json" | jq -r '.[].name_value' | sed 's/\*\.//g' | sort -u
```

This command fetches JSON-formatted data from `crt.sh` for `example.com` (the `%` is a wildcard), extracts domain names using `jq`, removes any wildcard prefixes (`*.`) with `sed`, and finally sorts and deduplicates the results.
